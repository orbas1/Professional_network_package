# Agent Instructions – Professional Social Network Utilities, Security & Analytics Package (Laravel + Flutter)

## Overall Goal

Your goal is to create:

1. A **Laravel package**
2. A **Flutter mobile addon package**

that together provide the **same enhanced utilities, security and analytics functionality** on both:

* The **Laravel backend / web app**, and
* The **Flutter mobile app**.

These will plug into an existing **Sociopro-based social media platform**, moving it towards a **LinkedIn-style professional network**. This package is an **addon wrapper** that **extends** Sociopro without overriding or breaking core behaviour.

> ⚠️ Important: **Do not copy any binary files** (e.g. images, fonts, compiled assets, `.exe`, `.dll`, `.so`, APKs, etc.).

> ⚠️ Important: Assume Sociopro already provides core social features (users, posts, comments, stories, chat, marketplace, notifications, etc.). You must build **on top of** these, using **new namespaced code, config flags and adapters**, not by renaming or deleting existing core logic.

---

## Integration Principles

* Treat Sociopro as **the source of truth** for:

  * User accounts, authentication, core posts, comments, base stories, base chat, base marketplace.
* This utilities/security/analytics package must:

  * **Wrap and extend** existing features.
  * Use **new routes, views, controllers, services and tables** under clear namespaces.
  * Be **config-driven and opt-in** via a config file.
  * Avoid name collisions with Sociopro models, controllers and tables.

Everything should be **modular**, so features can be turned on/off without breaking the main site or app.

---

## Part 1 – Laravel Package

### 1. Config

Create a config file, e.g. `config/pro_network_utilities_security_analytics.php`, with:

* Global feature toggles, for example:

  * `features.connections_graph` (1st/2nd/3rd degree & My Network)
  * `features.recommendations`
  * `features.live_streaming_enhanced`
  * `features.notifications_wrapper`
  * `features.marketplace_escrow`
  * `features.profile_professional_upgrades`
  * `features.reactions_dislikes_scores`
  * `features.stories_wrapper`
  * `features.post_enhancements`
  * `features.hashtags`
  * `features.music_library`
  * `features.bad_word_checker`
  * `features.moderation_tools`
  * `features.file_scan`
  * `features.db_encryption`
  * `features.storage_backends`
  * `features.account_types`
  * `features.search_upgrade`
  * `features.chat_enhancements`
  * `features.analytics_hub`
  * `features.security_hardening`
  * `features.age_verification`
  * `features.newsletters`
  * `features.invite_contributors`
  * `features.multi_language_wrapper`

* Integration settings:

  * Reference to existing analytics driver or logger (if any) – you wrap it, you do not overwrite it.
  * External virus scanner endpoint/keys (e.g. ClamAV or third-party API).
  * Age/KYC verification provider placeholders.
  * Cloudflare R2, Wasabi and local storage configuration names (you only orchestrate their use).
  * Security settings (rate limits, brute force thresholds, IP reputation settings, GDPR logging flags).

All features should be **disabled by default** and enabled explicitly.

---

### 3. Screens / Pages

Implement Flutter screens for:

* **My Network** (LinkedIn-style):

By following this document, the agent should:

* Build a **modular Laravel package** and **Flutter addon** that wrap and extend Sociopro.

* Offer clear integration points for feed, search, analytics, security, storage, and mobile UX.


Agent Instructions – Professional Social Network Utilities, Security & Analytics Package (Laravel + Flutter)
Overall Goal

Your goal is to create:

A Laravel package

A Flutter mobile addon package

that together provide the same enhanced utilities, security, and analytics functionality on both:

The Laravel backend / web app, and

The Flutter mobile app.

These will plug into an existing Sociopro-based social media platform, turning it into a LinkedIn-style professional network with modern utilities, analytics and hard security – without breaking or replacing Sociopro’s core.

⚠️ Important: Do not copy any binary files (e.g. images, fonts, compiled assets, .exe, .dll, .so, APKs, etc.).

⚠️ Important: Sociopro already provides users, posts, comments, stories, chat, marketplace, notifications, etc.
This package is a wrapper/addon that extends and augments that behaviour via new namespaced code.

Integration Principles (Sociopro-safe)

Treat Sociopro as the core engine:

Do not rename or delete core controllers, models, migrations, or routes.

This package must:

Use its own namespaces and own tables.

Interact with Sociopro via:

Existing models (e.g. User, Post, Message, Page, Group).

Events, observers, and service calls.

Be config-driven and opt-in via a single config file.

If there is a clash (route name, view name, JS var), rename on the addon side, never touch Sociopro core.

Part 1 – Laravel Package
1. Config

Create config/pro_network_utilities_security_analytics.php with:

Feature toggles, e.g.:
